relative to symlink, and one\n * relative to the current working directory. Checks if path is absolute or\n * relative. If the path is relative, this function checks if the path is\n * relative to symlink or relative to current working directory. This is an\n * initiative to find a smarter `srcpath` to supply when building symlinks.\n * This allows you to determine which path to use out of one of three possible\n * types of source paths. The first is an absolute path. This is detected by\n * `path.isAbsolute()`. When an absolute path is provided, it is checked to\n * see if it exists. If it does it's used, if not an error is returned\n * (callback)/ thrown (sync). The other two options for `srcpath` are a\n * relative url. By default Node's `fs.symlink` works by creating a symlink\n * using `dstpath` and expects the `srcpath` to be relative to the newly\n * created symlink. If you provide a `srcpath` that does not exist on the file\n * system it results in a broken symlink. To minimize this, the function\n * checks to see if the 'relative to symlink' source file exists, and if it\n * does it will use it.

It uses\r\n * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\r\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\r\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\r\n *\r\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\r\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\r\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\r\n *\r\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\r\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\r\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\r\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\r\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\r\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\r\n */\nvar Calendar = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Calendar',\n\n\n  propTypes: {\n\n    /**\r\n     * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\r\n     */\n    elementProps: _react.PropTypes.object,\n\n    /**\r\n     * The current date value of the calendar.
